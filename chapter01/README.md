# Alexa Skill Trader Example, #01

This is the first part of a tutorial on how I built an Alexa skill to execute trades with the [Alpaca API](https://docs.alpaca.markets).

## Spec

- Creates the Alexa skill and links it with an AWS Lambda function

- Adds the script to the AWS Lambda function and allows execution of a simple market order with the Alpaca API

## How to run it

Install the requirements:

```sh
$ npm i ask-sdk-core ask-sdk-model @alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api
```

After writing the script, upload to Lambda as a zipped directory and link the Lambda function to Alexa.
