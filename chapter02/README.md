# Alexa Skill Trader Example, #02

This is the second and final part of a tutorial on how I built an Alexa skill to execute trades with the [Alpaca API](https://docs.alpaca.markets).

## Spec

- Adds more commands for Alexa, such as getting open positions and portfolio performance

## How to run it

Install the requirements:

```sh
$ npm i ask-sdk-core ask-sdk-model @alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api
```

After writing the script, upload to Lambda as a zipped directory and link the Lambda function to Alexa.
